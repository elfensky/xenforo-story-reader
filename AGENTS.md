## Worktrees — one lane, always

Every session — feature, chore or one-line fix — works in its own worktree under `.worktrees/`
(git-ignored), never in the main checkout. The main checkout stays on `main` and moves only by
`git pull --ff-only`: a branch parked there is how parallel sessions commit onto each other's work.
Every change reaches `main` by a PR. The why: vault `knowledge/developer/stack/git-and-prs.md`.

```bash
git status -sb && git pull --ff-only             # main checkout: sync only, never commit here
git worktree prune && git fetch -q --prune origin
git worktree add --lock --reason "$(hostname -s)" .worktrees/<slug> -b <type>/<slug> origin/main
cd .worktrees/<slug>                             # work and commit here
git push -u origin HEAD && gh pr create --base main --fill
gh pr checks --watch --required && gh pr merge --rebase --delete-branch
cd - && git pull --ff-only
git worktree unlock .worktrees/<slug> && git worktree remove .worktrees/<slug> && git branch -D <type>/<slug>
```

A new worktree has no dependencies installed: run `npm ci` in it first. A locked worktree
you did not create belongs to another session — leave it. `.claude/worktrees/` is Claude Code's own
subagent isolation and is managed by the harness.

## Life cockpit

Tracked in the life-cockpit vault under `#personal` (tracker: `elfensky/xenforo-story-reader`). The cockpit is the
control plane (what to work on); this repo is where the work happens. Report progress by
opening/closing issues and PRs as usual — the cockpit pulls from the tracker on its next
`/sync`. Nothing to update in the vault; don't mirror cockpit state (milestones, due dates) here.
GSD projects: after `/gsd-new-project`, run `/cockpit-gsd-profile` once in this repo before planning the first slice.
Roadmap: this repo owns its roadmap. `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (GSD) is the one roadmap file here; no second
roadmap file lives in this repo. A session in this repo publishes it to projects.static.lav.ren through
keijiban (`elfensky/keijiban`); the vault keeps the enrollment only, never a copy of the plan.
